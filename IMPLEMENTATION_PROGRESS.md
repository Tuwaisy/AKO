## üêõ **Known Issues and Technical Debt**

1. **TypeScript Errors**: All API routes have TypeScript compilation errors due to missing dependencies (will be resolved when dependencies are installed)

2. **Missing Implementations**: Several route files are placeholder implementations that need completion

3. **Security Considerations**: 
   - JWT secrets are hardcoded in .env (need secure generation)
   - No rate limiting on sensitive endpoints
   - Missing input sanitization in some endpoints

4. **Performance Optimizations Needed**:
   - Database query optimization
   - Caching strategy implementation
   - File upload size handling

5. **Testing**: No unit or integration tests implemented yet
